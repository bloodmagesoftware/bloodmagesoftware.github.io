		Welcome to Bloodmage Software, where we breathe new life into
		retro-style gaming experiences! Our studio is dedicated to crafting
		captivating story adventure games that harken back to the golden era of
		gaming while infusing them with fresh narratives and innovative gameplay
		mechanics.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4">
		At Bloodmage Software, we take pride in our unique approach to game
		development. Unlike other game studios, we eschew popular game engines
		like Unreal or Unity in favor of <Link href="https://bevyengine.org/">
			Bevy
		</Link>.
		<Link href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</Link> is a free and open source,
		data-driven game engine built in Rust, providing us with the flexibility
		and control needed to bring our creative visions to life.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4">
		But that's not all — our games are not only crafted with passion but
		also with a commitment to open source principles. Every line of code
		behind our games is freely available for exploration and modification by
		the community, fostering collaboration and creativity among developers
		and gamers alike.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4">
		Join us on our journey as we continue to push the boundaries of
		retro-style gaming, blending nostalgia with innovation to create
		unforgettable adventures for players old and new.
